This site uses cookies to store some information. Big surprise, most sites do these days. But don't worry, you don't need to worry about them, or opt in, or opt out. In fact, here's everything we store with cookies.

- Your user token, so we can keep you logged in when you visit a different page.
- Your username, so we can load your profile picture.

**That's it.** We don't collect your personal info. We don't target ads at you (because there are none on this website).

GitForum is written entirely client-side, so no data is sent to us. We have nowhere to store any data we might collect. This website is essentially just a front end slapped onto GitHub's API. So any data from this site goes to nobody but GitHub.

*You're welcome.*
