GitForum is not completely open. We're not gonna go suppressing free speech, but we're also not gonna allow everything on this platform. Luckily for us, we don't actually need to set all of the rules, because GitHub have essentially done it for us. **As this site is hosted and integrated with GitHub, all content must follow [GitHub's acceptable use policies.](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)**

Any content posted can be removed at our discretion, and your access to the site (GitForum, not GitHub) may be disabled if you repeatedly fail to follow the rules. We are not affilitated with GitHub in any way, and if they make the decision to ban you from their site, that is not a decision we will have been involved in.

*Most importantly though, use your head and don't be a dick. You're talking to real humans.*
