<p>GitForum is an experiment we created based on a simple joke. I [<a href="https://jbritain.github.io">jbritain</a>] was talking with my good friend <a href="https://github.com/TheGooseLord">TheGooseLord</a> when one of us jokingly wondered whether it would be possible to create a forum like Reddit using GitHub's issue system. If you're not familiar with GitHub, it allows you to publicly host the code to a piece of software you've created, where others can look at it and suggest changes or improvements. One of the features allowing this is GitHub Issues, where a user can create a new issue in which they explain a problem with the software, how to reproduce it, and so on. What's useful about this is that *anyone can create an issue* if the permissions are set correctly, and others can comment and react to issues, allowing for a discussion on how to fix it. Alternatively, you could piggyback on it to create your own social media free of charge. And hence, GitForum was born.</p>
