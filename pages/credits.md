All of the code in the repo is written by [TheGooseLord](https://github.com/TheGooseLord) and [jbritain](https://jbritain.github.io), though I'm sure some will be suspiciously similar to answers on StackOverflow. That said, we've used a number of libraries/tools to make life easier for us. 

## Things we've used
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a simple to use but very clean CSS framework you will have heard of.
- [JS-Cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) allows us to more easily store the whole two cookies this site uses.
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) prints time differences nicely.
- [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) renders markdown so easily I only added one line of code to support markdown rendering in posts.
- [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) is a markdown editor that both fits in with Bootstrap very nicely but is also very easy to use and took only a few lines of code to integrate.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) powers this entire project, both by hosting the site through github pages and through providing an API that allows us to create and fetch issues programmatically.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) hosts the bot we currently use to assign labels to issues since this cannot be done client-side by normal users. I do hope to migrate it to the Raspberry Pi that sits under my bed though.

Aardvark Industries, jbritain, TheGooseLord, and GitForum are not affiliated with GitHub in anyway. We do use their servers though.
